Application Description: 
Cant-forget-your-face is an web applicaiton developed by me and my 3 group members for CSCI 3308 Software Development Methods and Tools. Cant-forget-your-face is a two-factor authenticated system that uses facial recognition to assist in verifying the identity of the user. We thought facial recogition would be an interesting chioce for a few main reasons. The first reason is obvious, facial recognition is fascinating technology. Secondly, we wanted to challenge ourselves to build something really cool. Most groups built something based off of the weekly labs we had been doing throughout the semester, which were mostly just e-commerce storefronts. We, instead, wanted to use the oppurtunity to get even further outside of our comfort zone. Having weekly stand-up meetings with our TA was crucial as it allowed us to consult someone with industry expereince. After settling on an idea, we had to decide what framework we wanted to deploy our web app in. Since the facial recognition was written in Python, we decided that a python framework would probably be most suitable.
